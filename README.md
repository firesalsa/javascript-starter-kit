# Javascript Starter Kit

This README serves as a guide for what you can expect from the Javascript Starter Kit.

## Sharing your work

Share your work with localtunnel by exposing localhost to the Internet.  Two terminals 
need to be used simultaneously in order for this to work.

Run `npm start` in one terminal and `npm run share` in the other.  The second command
will give you a dynamically generated URL you can use to share with other developers
who want to see your work.
